# This is a Rails app and we want to load all the files in the app 
# when running this code.  To do so, your current working directory
# should be the top-level directory (i.e. /workspace/your-app/) and then run:
# rails runner labs/3-associations.rb

# Lab 3: Associations
# - We've added data into the contacts table.  Next, we'll add data
#   into the activities table.  Follow the steps below to insert
#   activity data in the database.  Afterwards, display a
#   single salesperson's activity data:

# 1. insert 3 rows in the activities table with relationships to
# a single salesperson and 2 different contacts
puts "Activities: #{Activity.all.count}"

camila = Salesperson.find_by({"first_name" => "Camila", "last_name" => "FranÃ§a"})
cook = Contact.find_by({"first_name" => "Tim", "last_name" => "Cook"})

call1 = Activity.new
call1["notes"] = "quick checkin"
call1["salesperson_id"] = camila["id"]
call1["contact_id"] = cook["id"]
call1.save

craig = Contact.find_by({"first_name" => "Craig", "last_name" => "Federight"})
call2 = Activity.new
call2["notes"] = "long checkin"
call2["salesperson_id"] = camila["id"]
call2["contact_id"] = craig["id"]
call2.save

puts call1.inspect
puts "Activities: #{Activity.all.count}"

# 2. Display all the activities between the salesperson used above
# and one of the contacts (sample output below):

activities = Activity.where({"salesperson_id" => camila["id"], "contact_id" => cook["id"]})
puts activities 

#
